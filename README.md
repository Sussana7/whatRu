# whatRu? 🌟  
*A simple, modern social feed for sharing what you're doing — right now.*

---

## 🖼️ Overview
**whatRu?** is a sleek and minimal social feed app built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It's inspired by the idea of capturing the *present moment* — whether you're reading, listening, working on something, or just doing life.

This project is part of **my journey to learn React and Tailwind CSS**.  
I'm building **whatRu?** to strengthen my understanding of component-based design, state management, and responsive UI styling while creating something fun and real.
