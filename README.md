WhatRu? üåü

A simple, modern social feed for sharing what you're doing ‚Äî right now.

üñºÔ∏è Overview

whatRu? is a sleek and minimal social feed app built with React and Tailwind CSS.
It's inspired by the idea of capturing the present moment ‚Äî whether you're reading, listening, working on something, or just doing life.

This project is part of my journey to learn React and Tailwind CSS.
I'm building whatRu? to strengthen my understanding of component-based design, state management, and responsive UI styling while creating something fun and real.

üìÖ Development Progress

Day 1 ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Set up project structure with Vite + React + Tailwind CSS
- Created header with app name and "Share" button
- Built CreatePost modal component with form inputs
- Created README and initialized GitHub repository

Day 2 ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Designed filter buttons for categories (All, Reading, Listening, Working on, Doing)
- Added filter state management and conditional styling
- Created mockPosts.json with sample data
- Built PostCard component to display individual posts
- Implemented filtering functionality - posts filter by category
- Fixed import issues and made the app fully functional

Day 3 ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Made CreatePost form functional (add new posts to feed)
- Fixed modal closing (no page reload, smooth transitions)
- Added username capture and display
- Posts now display with username, title, content, category, and timestamp
- New posts appear at the top of the feed

**What I Learned Today:**
- Controlled input components (value + onChange)
- Lifting state up between parent and child components
- Passing functions as props
- Form submission with preventDefault()
- Updating arrays in state (adding items to beginning with spread operator)

 Day 4 - Dark Mode Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Theme toggle component with sun/moon icons
- Full dark mode support across entire application
- Smooth transitions between light and dark themes
- Dark mode styling for all components:
  - CurrentlyBoard (main layout, header, filters)
  - PostCard (individual post cards)
  - CreatePost (modal form)
  - ThemeToggle (toggle button itself)

**What I Learned:**
* Tailwind CSS dark mode configuration (`darkMode: 'class'`)
* Lifting state up to App level for global theme control
* Passing props down through component hierarchy
* Using conditional classes for theme switching
* Applying `dark:` variants to style elements differently in dark mode
* Managing theme state with useState
* Props destructuring in React components

### Day 5 (Tomorrow) - Interactive Features
**Planned Features:**
* Add like/unlike functionality to posts ‚ù§Ô∏è
* Add comments section (display and add comments)
* Sort posts by newest first

**What I'll Learn Tomorrow:**
* Updating nested state structures
* Finding and modifying specific items in arrays
* Rendering dynamic lists with nested data
* Building more complex component interactions
* State management with multiple levels of data

## üé® Color Palette

**Light Mode:**
* Background: Slate gradients (50-200)
* Cards: White with subtle shadows
* Primary: Red-800
* Text: Gray-900, Gray-700, Gray-500

**Dark Mode:**
* Background: Gray gradients (900-800)
* Cards: Gray-800 with darker shadows
* Primary: Red-400
* Text: White, Gray-300, Gray-400
